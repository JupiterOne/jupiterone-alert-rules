## QA Checklist

### Alerts Rule Packs

- [ ] IF THIS CONTENT NEEDS TO BE RELEASED - is the package version in the package.json bumped?
- [ ] Does a related alert already exist, and should it be tweaked or added to instead?
- [ ] Test each query to make sure it works
- [ ] Look for hardcoded variables/parameter values in the query
- [ ] Consider Severity for Alerts
- [ ] Spellcheck
- [ ] Use all caps for J1QL keywords and relationship classes
- [ ] Upload the alerts rule pack JSON into JupiterOne to validate
